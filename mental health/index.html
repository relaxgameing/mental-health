            Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional
            well-being. It is all about how people think, feel, and behave.
            People sometimes use the term “mental health” to mean the absence of
            a mental disorder. Mental health can affect daily living,
            relationships, and physical health.

            However, this link also works in the other direction. Factors in
            people’s lives, interpersonal connections, and physical factors can
            all contribute to mental health disruptions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Looking after mental health can preserve a person’s ability to enjoy
            life. Doing this involves reaching a balance between life
            activities, responsibilities, and efforts to achieve psychological
            resilience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conditions such as stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect
            mental health and disrupt a person’s routine.

            Mental health is an integral part of health; indeed, there is no
            health without mental health.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mental health is determined by a range of socioeconomic, biological
            and environmental factors.

          <li>
            Cost-effective public health and intersectoral strategies and

        <p>
          Mental health promotion involves actions that improve psychological
          well-being. This may involve creating an environment that supports
          mental health.

          <p>
            An environment that respects and protects basic civil, political,
            socio-economic and cultural rights is fundamental to mental health.
            Without the security and freedom provided by these rights, it is
            difficult to maintain a high level of mental health.

        <p>
          National mental health policies should be concerned both with mental
          disorders and, with broader issues that promote mental health. Mental
          health promotion should be mainstreamed into governmental and
          nongovernmental policies and programmes. In addition to the health
          sector, it is essential to involve the education, labour, justice,
          transport, environment, housing, and welfare sectors.

            In the context of national efforts to develop and implement mental
            health policy, it is vital to not only protect and promote the
            mental well-being of its citizens, but also address the needs of
            persons with defined mental disorders.

              Knowledge of what to do about the escalating burden of mental
              disorders has improved substantially over the past decade. There
              is a growing body of evidence demonstrating both the efficacy and
              cost-effectiveness of key interventions for priority mental
              disorders in countries at different levels of economic
              development. Examples of interventions that are cost-effective,
              feasible, and affordable include:

              treatment of depression with psychological treatment and, for

            </li>
            <li>
              treatment of psychosis with antipsychotic medicines and
              psychosocial support;
            </li>
            <li>
              taxation of alcoholic beverages and restriction of their

            A range of effective measures also exists for the prevention of
            suicide, prevention and treatment of mental disorders in children,
            prevention and treatment of dementia, and treatment of substance-use
            disorders. The mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) has
            produced evidence based guidance for non-specialists to enable them
            to better identify and manage a range of priority mental health
            conditions
